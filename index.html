            <h1>Whats happened over the last year?</h1>
            <p>
                It's been a heck of a time, Godot 4.0 was release and Unity
                tried to destroy everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot has happened over the last year, there has been minor
                developments and major developments. Things have come a long
                way, but with that there where also set backs. In terms of 
                good news, Godot launched its 4.0 version and gained a bunch
                of new users, but I gained those new users for a not so great
                reason. Another game engine, Unity made retroactive changes
                to their user agreement that would have made it impossible for
                some game studios to keep their doors open.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dispite the challenges that showed up, there have still been
                many sucessful indie game launches over the last year. Names
                such as Moonstone Island, Dave the Diver, and Sea of Stars
                probably sound familiar to you by now. Some more detail about
                those and others will be further down.

                It took three years of development, but the highly anticipated
                Godot 4.0 update released March 1st 2023. A highlight feature for
                this release is the new Vulkan renderer, with it comes better lighting
                and higher quality shadows. The new Vulkan renderer is for higher grade
                hardware systems, while and OpenGL solution was developed for low end
                and mobile devices. In 4.0 the OpenGL renderer had great 2D
                support and limited 3D support, but plan to add further 
                support in later updates.

                For years Godot has been on an upward trend, but with the 
                release of 4.0 and recent events at Unity they've had two
                spikes in popularity. More and more people are starting
                to hear about the Open Source engine and with user trust 
                faiding in corporations, people are seeing Godot as their
                next best option and in some cases their only option moving
                forward.

                The once beloved game engine Unity flew just a little to
                close to the sun this year. In September 2023, unity anounced
                that there would be retroactive changes to their Runtime fee.
                The change that caused most of the problems was that 
                developers would be charged 0.05 cents per install of their 
                game after specified income threshholds where passed. In some
                cases this would mean developers had to give Unity all the
                income their game generated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, Unity has made modifications the the new Runtime fee
                that solve most of the issues people had with it. Still, many 
                developers say they no longer have trust in the company and 
                are calling for the CEO - John Riccitello to step down. On 
                October 9th, 2023 many peoples pleas were met because 
                John Riccitello stepped down as the CEO after nearly ten years.
                But for many developers this means nothing, Unity Technologies
                has already broken what trust they had and will likely never
                fully regain what was lost.
